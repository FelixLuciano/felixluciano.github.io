I am Luciano Felix, a student starting my career in computer engineering. I have been studying [programming](#Programming) for over 6 years, and I create publications on Codepen with the knowledge I have been acquiring over time.

On Instagram I publish [photographs](#Photography) that explore a subjective perspective of objects through the distortion of their meanings. I have recorded in my storyes some of the exhibitions I visited in the editions of [SP-Arte](https://www.sp-arte.com/), the largest art fair in latin america.

I am the creator of [Mini Elementarium](https://felixluciano.github.io/mini-elementarium/), a project that started with the idea of an algorithm and gained complexity with the collaboration of several people. With this project, I aim to promote the study of chemistry to everyone with an application that assists in this process.
